Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on the concept of objects, their properties (attributes), and behaviors (methods), allowing for modular, reusable, and structured code design.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is typically a class. It promotes data hiding and information hiding, ensuring that the internal state and implementation details of an object are not directly accessible from outside the object. Encapsulation helps achieve data integrity, security, and abstraction by controlling access through well-defined interfaces.

Data Hiding
Data hiding is a principle closely related to encapsulation. It involves concealing the internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary information through well-defined interfaces. By hiding implementation details, the object's data is protected and can only be accessed or modified through controlled methods. This enhances data security, code maintainability, and reduces the risk of unintended modifications or access to critical data.

Inheritance
Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows new classes (derived classes or subclasses) to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (base classes or superclasses). Inheritance promotes code reuse, as derived classes can inherit and extend the functionality of their base classes. The derived classes can add new attributes and behaviors or override existing ones to customize the behavior of inherited members. Inheritance facilitates code organization, modularity, and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types in a uniform manner.

Polymorphism is often illustrated through inheritance, where you have a base class and multiple derived classes that inherit from it. The derived classes can override or extend the behavior of the base class's methods, while still adhering to the common interface.
