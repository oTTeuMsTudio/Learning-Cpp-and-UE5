# Benefits of using C++ with Unreal Engine

> This section was written in conjunction with Leo, Brave`s build-in AI.

High performance: C++ allows you to write code that can run directly on the CPU and GPU, making it possible to achieve very high performance levels in your game or application.

Integration with existing codebases: If you have existing C++ code that you want to integrate with your Unreal Engine project, using C++ allows you to do so more easily.

Access to low-level functionality: C++ gives you access to lower-level functionality than other programming languages, which can be especially useful in game development where fine-grained control over memory, data structures, and algorithms is often necessary.

Garbage Collection and Memory Management: While C++ demands manual memory management, Unreal Engine provides a garbage collector that efficiently clears out UObject classes from memory. With the control over manual memory handling, you can precisely dictate when to allocate and deallocate memory as necessary.
