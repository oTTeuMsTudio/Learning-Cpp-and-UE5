# Benefits of using C++ with Unreal Engine

> ### This section was written in conjunction with ChatGPT.

- High performance: C++ allows you to write code that can run directly on the CPU and GPU, making it possible to achieve very high performance levels in your game or application.

- Integration with existing codebases: If you have existing C++ code that you want to integrate with your Unreal Engine project, using C++ allows you to do so more easily.

- Access to low-level functionality: C++ gives you access to lower-level functionality than other programming languages, which can be especially useful in game development where fine-grained control over memory, data structures, and algorithms is often necessary.

- Garbage Collection and Memory Management: While C++ demands manual memory management, Unreal Engine provides a garbage collector that efficiently clears out UObject classes from memory. With the control over manual memory handling, you can precisely dictate when to allocate and deallocate memory as necessary.

Using C++ with Unreal Engine offers several advantages:

- **High-performance gameplay logic:** C++ allows for direct access to hardware resources, enabling the creation of high-performance and complex gameplay mechanics, user interfaces, and editor extensions.
- **Flexibility and customization:** C++ provides unparalleled flexibility and customization options, enabling developers to tailor their game’s behavior and functionality to specific requirements.
- **Integration with native libraries and frameworks:** C++ enables seamless integration with native libraries and frameworks, such as physics engines, audio libraries, and graphics drivers, providing a more efficient and optimized game experience.
- **Compatibility with existing C++ code:** For developers already familiar with C++, using it with Unreal Engine means they can leverage their existing knowledge and codebase, reducing the learning curve and development time.
- **Advanced component-based architecture:** C++ allows for a deeper understanding and manipulation of Unreal Engine’s component-based architecture, enabling developers to create custom components and extend the engine’s capabilities.

While Unreal Engine’s Blueprint visual scripting system provides a more accessible entry point for developers, using C++ can be beneficial for:

- **Complex or performance-critical logic:** C++ is better suited for handling complex or performance-critical logic, allowing developers to optimize and fine-tune their code for maximum efficiency.
- **Customization and extensibility:** C++ provides the necessary low-level control for developers who need to customize or extend Unreal Engine’s behavior, components, or plugins.

Ultimately, using C++ with Unreal Engine offers a balance between flexibility, performance, and customization, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking to create high-quality, complex, and optimized games.
