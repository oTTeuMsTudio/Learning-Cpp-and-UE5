# Getting started with C++ for Unreal Engine 5

To begin developing with C++ in Unreal Engine, follow these steps:

## 1. Understand the differences: 

C++ development in Unreal Engine is distinct from regular C++ programming. Focus on learning Unreal Engine-specific concepts, such as:
  - Unreal Engine’s C++ class hierarchy and inheritance
  - UE macros and their usage
  - Engine-specific data types and variables

## 2. Start with a simple project: 

Create a new Unreal Engine project and build a small Blueprint-based game. This will help you understand the engine’s architecture and node-based workflow.

## 3. Convert Blueprints to C++: 

Identify a Blueprint function or feature you’d like to implement in C++. Attempt to convert it to a C++ function, using Unreal Engine’s C++ class and macro structure.

## 4. Use online resources: 

Leverage online tutorials, courses, and guides, such as:
  - Tom Looman’s Unreal Engine C++ Tutorials and courses
  - Epic Games’ Official Unreal Engine course platform
  - Online forums and communities, like the Unreal Engine subreddit

## 5. Practice and experiment: 

Apply your knowledge by implementing small C++ features or plugins in your Unreal Engine project. This will help solidify your understanding of the engine’s C++ API.

## 6. Utilize ChatGPT: 

If you’re struggling to write C++ code or understand specific UE macros, use ChatGPT to get started or clarify concepts. However, be prepared to troubleshoot and evaluate its responses.

7. Join online communities: Participate in online forums and communities to connect with other developers, ask questions, and learn from their experiences.

### Recommended Resources:

- Tom Looman’s Unreal Engine C++ Tutorials and courses
- Epic Games’ Official Unreal Engine course platform
- Unreal Engine subreddit
- Online forums and communities

### Additional Tips:

- Start with a clean and simple project, like Tom Looman’s FPS Template or a basic Actor-based project.
- Focus on understanding Unreal Engine’s C++ class hierarchy and inheritance.
- Experiment with different C++ features and plugins to gain a deeper understanding of the engine’s capabilities.
- Be patient and persistent; C++ development in Unreal Engine can be challenging, especially for beginners.

C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose programming language that offers a combination of high-level and low-level features. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979 as an enhancement to the C language, originally named C1 with Classes and later renamed C++ in 1983.

You can read more about C++ Language Reference from Microsoft Learn.

Using C++ with Unreal Engine unlocks the engine's full feature set, allowing developers to harness advanced graphics rendering, physics simulations, networking, and AI capabilities. C++ provides a level of control, customization, and performance optimization that complements visual scripting.

Developing with C++ in Unreal Engine enables better debugging, profiling, and performance optimization through techniques such as multithreading and memory management. It also facilitates integration with third-party libraries, expanding the range of functionality and flexibility available to developers.

You can read more about it on their docs.

To use C++ effectively in Unreal Engine, it is crucial to have a strong foundation in programming principles and understanding of Unreal Engine's architecture and conventions. Leveraging resources like the Unreal Engine documentation, community forums, and collaboration with other developers helps to gain knowledge and best practices.

By combining the power of C++ and Unreal Engine, developers can create immersive experiences and unlock the full potential of the engine's capabilities.
