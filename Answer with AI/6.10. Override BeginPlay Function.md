# Override BeginPlay Function

In Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), the `BeginPlay()` function is a virtual method in the `AActor` class, which is inherited by all actors, including characters, vehicles, and other game objects. To override `BeginPlay()` in a C++ class, follow these steps:

### 1.Declare the override: 
In your C++ class header (.h file), declare the BeginPlay() function as virtual and override:

```c++
class AMyActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;
};
```
### 2. Implement the override: 
In your C++ class implementation (.cpp file), provide the implementation for BeginPlay():

```c++
void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    // Custom initialization code here
    Super::BeginPlay(); // Call the parent's implementation
}
```

### Important notes:

- Make sure to include the `Super::BeginPlay()` call to ensure that the parent’s implementation is executed.
- If you want to prevent the parent’s `BeginPlay()` from being called, you can remove the `Super::BeginPlay()` line. However, this is generally not recommended, as it may break functionality or cause unexpected behavior.
- In Blueprints, you cannot directly override the `BeginPlay()` function. Instead, create a custom event or function and call it from the `BeginPlay()` implementation in your C++ class.
- 
By following these steps, you can effectively override the `BeginPlay()` function in your UE5 C++ class and customize the initialization behavior for your actors.
