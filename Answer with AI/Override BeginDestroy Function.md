# Override Begin Destroy Function UE5

In Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), BeginDestroy() is a protected virtual function in the UObject class. It is called before an object is destroyed, allowing derived classes to perform any necessary cleanup or destruction logic.

To override BeginDestroy() in UE5, follow these steps:

1. Create a subclass of UObject (or any other class that inherits from UObject) and declare a virtual override for BeginDestroy():

```c++
class MYOBJECT : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

    virtual void BeginDestroy() override;
};
```

2. Implement the `BeginDestroy()` function in your subclass:

```c++
void MYOBJECT::BeginDestroy()
{
    // Add your custom cleanup or destruction logic here
    Super::BeginDestroy(); // Call the parent's implementation
}
```

Note that Super::BeginDestroy() is called to ensure that the parent’s implementation is executed as well. This is important, as BeginDestroy() may perform necessary cleanup or notifications in the parent class.

By overriding BeginDestroy(), you can customize the destruction process for your objects and ensure that any necessary resources are released or cleaned up properly.

Important: Make sure to include the GENERATED_BODY() macro in your class declaration to enable code generation for your subclass. This macro is required for UE5’s code generation system to work correctly.
