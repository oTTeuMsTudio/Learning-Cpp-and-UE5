# C++ for Unreal Engine Start

To begin developing with C++ in Unreal Engine, follow these steps:

## 1. Understand the differences: 

C++ development in Unreal Engine is distinct from regular C++ programming. Focus on learning Unreal Engine-specific concepts, such as:
  - Unreal Engine’s C++ class hierarchy and inheritance
  - UE macros and their usage
  - Engine-specific data types and variables

## 2. Start with a simple project: 

Create a new Unreal Engine project and build a small Blueprint-based game. This will help you understand the engine’s architecture and node-based workflow.

## 3. Convert Blueprints to C++: 

Identify a Blueprint function or feature you’d like to implement in C++. Attempt to convert it to a C++ function, using Unreal Engine’s C++ class and macro structure.

## 4. Use online resources: 

Leverage online tutorials, courses, and guides, such as:
  - Tom Looman’s Unreal Engine C++ Tutorials and courses
  - Epic Games’ Official Unreal Engine course platform
  - Online forums and communities, like the Unreal Engine subreddit

## 5. Practice and experiment: 

Apply your knowledge by implementing small C++ features or plugins in your Unreal Engine project. This will help solidify your understanding of the engine’s C++ API.

## 6. Utilize ChatGPT: 

If you’re struggling to write C++ code or understand specific UE macros, use ChatGPT to get started or clarify concepts. However, be prepared to troubleshoot and evaluate its responses.

7. Join online communities: Participate in online forums and communities to connect with other developers, ask questions, and learn from their experiences.

### Recommended Resources:

- Tom Looman’s Unreal Engine C++ Tutorials and courses
- Epic Games’ Official Unreal Engine course platform
- Unreal Engine subreddit
- Online forums and communities

### Additional Tips:

- Start with a clean and simple project, like Tom Looman’s FPS Template or a basic Actor-based project.
- Focus on understanding Unreal Engine’s C++ class hierarchy and inheritance.
- Experiment with different C++ features and plugins to gain a deeper understanding of the engine’s capabilities.
- Be patient and persistent; C++ development in Unreal Engine can be challenging, especially for beginners.
