# Unreal Engine C++ Class Inheritance

In Unreal Engine, C++ classes are organized into a hierarchical structure using inheritance. This allows for code reuse, modularity, and easier maintenance. Here’s an overview of the class hierarchy and inheritance concepts:

## Class Hierarchy

### 1. Parent Classes: 
These are the base classes that define the common attributes and behaviors for a group of related classes.

### 2. Child Classes: 
These are derived classes that inherit properties and methods from parent classes.

### 3. Multiple Inheritance: 

Unreal Engine supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from multiple parent classes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. UCLASS(): 
A macro used to declare a C++ class in Unreal Engine. It generates a UClass object, which represents the class in the engine.

### 2. Generated Header Files: 
Unreal Engine automatically generates header files (e.g., ClassName.h) for each C++ class. These files contain the class declaration and other metadata.

### 3. Inheritance: 
Child classes inherit properties and methods from parent classes using the : syntax (e.g., class ChildClass : public ParentClass).

### 4. Virtual Functions: 
Unreal Engine uses virtual functions to enable polymorphism. Virtual functions are declared using the virtual keyword and can be overridden by derived classes.

### 5. Interface Classes: 
Unreal Engine provides a mechanism for defining interface classes using the IInterface base class. Interface classes define a contract that must be implemented by derived classes.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use meaningful class names: Choose class names that accurately reflect the class’s purpose and functionality.
### 2. Keep inheritance shallow: Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies, as they can lead to complexity and maintenance issues.
### 3. Use interfaces for polymorphism: Instead of using multiple inheritance, consider using interfaces to define polymorphic behavior.
### 4. Document your code: Use comments and documentation to explain the purpose and behavior of your classes and functions.

## Unreal Engine-Specific Considerations

### 1. UObject: 
All Unreal Engine C++ classes must inherit from UObject, which provides basic functionality and metadata.

### 2. UCLASS() macro: 
The UCLASS() macro is used to declare Unreal Engine C++ classes and generates a UClass object.

### 3. Component-based architecture: 
Unreal Engine uses a component-based architecture, where objects are composed of multiple components. This affects the design of your C++ classes and inheritance hierarchies.

## Example

Here’s an example of a simple Unreal Engine C++ class hierarchy:

// Parent class: AShapeActor
UCLASS()
class AShapeActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    // ...
};

// Child class: ACubeActor
class ACubeActor : public AShapeActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    // ...
    void SetLength(int new_length) { ... }
    void SetWidth(int new_width) { ... }
    void SetHeight(int new_height) { ... }
};

In this example, ACubeActor inherits from AShapeActor, which itself inherits from AActor. ACubeActor overrides some virtual functions and adds its own specific behavior.

By following these guidelines and best practices, you can effectively design and implement your C++ class hierarchy and inheritance in Unreal Engine.
